- "When the gyoza wrappers become translucent, remove the lid and turn up heat to high to cook off the water until the wrappers are nice and crisp."
- "Drizzle in sesame oil from the sides of the pan, then they are done. They are already seasoned, so serve them as they are."
- "You could also add Chinese chives or reconstituted dried shiitake mushrooms. Substituting the cabbage with Chinese cabbage is also tasty."
