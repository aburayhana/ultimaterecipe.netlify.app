recipeingredient:
- "500 gm Yoghurt"
- "1/4 cup water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add Yoghurt and water to a blender. If it&#39;s homemade Yoghurt, it&#39;s better. It gives appropriate results. That is why it should be a full fat thick and homemade one preferably."
- "Blend on high for 25-30 minutes. This churning in a blender might differ depending upon the blender you have. So do not worry or panic if yours takes a few minutes more."
- "A good quality high power watt blender is needed for this. If it gets heated up, stop for a while and then continue blending until blobs of butter are seen separated on the top."
- "The whey that remains can be used in curries or for salted buttermilk or chaas. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator and 1/2 kg of yoghurt yields about 1 cup of fresh white butter."
- "Homemade butter from yoghurt is all ready. Serve it with Parathas for a yummy meal."
