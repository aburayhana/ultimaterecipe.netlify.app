recipeingredient:
- "100 to 200 grams Ground chicken dark meat"
- "1 stalk Japanese leek"
- "1 Egg"
- "2 tbsp Weipa"
- "2 tbsp Hot water"
- "1 Sesame seeds"
- "1 packet Gyoza skins"
recipeinstructions:
- "Dissolve the Weipa paste in the hot water. If you don&#39;t have any Weipa, use Chinese soup stock granules and a little soy sauce."
- "Finely chop the leek: Make cuts along the length diagonally, on both sides. Slice, and you&#39;ll end up with very fine dice."
- "The ground chicken I used is from the thigh; it&#39;s juicier than breast meat. If you only have ground white chicken, add a little sesame oil to make it juicier."
- "Mix the ground chicken and the dissolved soup stock from step 1 until the mixture is sticky. Add the egg, leek and sesame seeds and mix well. It&#39;s OK if the mixture is very loose."
- "Wrap the mixture in gyoza skins in any shape you like. Form any leftover mixture into meatballs."
- "Bring a pan of water to a boil, and put in the meatballs first with a spoon."
- "Put in the gyoza dumplings. When they come floating to the surface and the skins are transparent they are done."
- "Eat with ponzu sauce. They&#39;re bouncy and juicy on the inside."
- "You can cool the meatballs and freeze them for use later in hot pots and so on."
- "This is a hamburger I made for my daughter with the meat mixture, panfried in a frying pan with cheese on top. You don&#39;t need any ketchup."
