recipeingredient:
- "200 g Pork Mince"
- "400 g cutminced vegetables we used carrots cabbage onions bean sprouts  think one of those Tescos Stir Fry packs"
- "2 tbsp Sesame Oil"
- "1/2 tsp crushed Kallo Just Bouillon Beef Stock Cube"
- "1 tsp ground ginger"
- "Pinch ground garlic"
- "Pinch black pepper"
- "35 GF Rice paper sheets sometimes it makes more"
- " for vegetarian replace the pork mince with minced mushrooms  add some spring onion for extra flavour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the pork and vegetables together. Add in 1 tbsp of sesame oil, and the seasonings. Mix well"
- "Follow the instructions for the rice paper. Normally you will need to soak each sheet of paper for 2 seconds in warm water. From there lay it flat on a plate to sit for another minute or two. It will be ready to roll when it feels soft and pliable."
- "Place a small amount (tsp) of the mixture in the centre of the rice paper. As the rice paper is much softer than normal gyoza dough, I find that being able to cover the filling with two or three turns of the rice paper will prevent breakage. This is where I messed up the first time I made these - but learned from it on round two :)"
- "Place 1 tbsp of sesame oil in a pan on medium heat. Add a little olive oil as well to really prevent those dumplings from sticking to the pan."
- "Cook for about 7 minutes, or until the pork seems to be cooked through. I usually put a cover on the pan in order to &#34;steam&#34; them through if you will. Some recipes recommend putting a bit of water in the pan to help with this process, but I haven&#39;t tried that with rice paper yet!"
- "Serve with some of Kikkoman&#39;s Gluten Free Soy Sauce! Enjoy!"
