recipeingredient:
- "150 grams Minced pork"
- "1/4 Cabbage or Chinese cabbage"
- "1 bunch Chinese chives"
- "1 clove Garlic grated"
- "1 piece Ginger"
- "1/4 Green onion or scallion"
- "2 tsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Sake"
- "1 tbsp Sesame oil"
- "1 tsp Salt"
- "2 tsp Katakuriko"
- "2 packs Gyoza skins"
- "2 tsp Sesame oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Finely chop the cabbage (or Chinese cabbage) and drain the moisture by rubbing it with salt. Finely chop the green onion, Chinese chives and ginger as well."
- "Combine the minced meat, vegetables, ★ seasoning ingredients, ginger, garlic and katakuriko in a bowl and mix well."
- "Place 1 heaped teaspoon of mixture on top of each gyoza skin, and whilst adding in the traditional creases, seal the fold with a dab of water around the edge."
- "Add some oil to a cold frying pan and line the gyoza up inside."
- "When you have put all of the gyoza into the pan, heat them until browned. Then pour some water into the pan until the gyoza are half-submerged, cover the pan with a lid, and steam cook the gyoza for 5 minutes."

- "Place a plate over the top of the pan and flip the gyoza out onto it. Ideally, the gyoza should be served with ponzu and chili oil, but a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar is just as delicious."
- "For Step 1, you can pre-boil the cabbage or Chinese cabbage before cutting it up if you like. Just make sure to drain out any excess moisture well."
