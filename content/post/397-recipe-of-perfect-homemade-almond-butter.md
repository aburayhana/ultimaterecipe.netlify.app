recipeingredient:
- "450 g (3 cups) almonds"
- " Salt  optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the almonds into the bowl of the food processor, fitted with the most deadly of blades (I think it&#39;s called an S blade)."
- "Switch on the machine and watch and listen as the almonds tumble about and clatter against its plastic sides."
- "The almonds will start to break down and become sandy in texture, a little like a crumble topping."
- "Keep going, stopping only to push the mixture down the sides of the bowl if it looks as though they&#39;re being left out."
- "Before long, your almond butter will start to look less grainy and more smooth, and will clump together like a dough. Keep going, keep going!"
- "The dough consistency turns into a smooth paste. At this stage, I poured a teaspoon or so of salt gradually down the funnel into the mixture. The almond butter is ready when you see it turn shiny - this is when the oils are released and the process is complete. It will feel warm to the touch, and tastes creamy and delicious."
- "Use as you would peanut butter, and store in a jar in the fridge for a couple of weeks. It probably won&#39;t last that long, though."
