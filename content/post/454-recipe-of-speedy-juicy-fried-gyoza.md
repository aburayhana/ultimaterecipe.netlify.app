recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Ground pork"
- "7 leaves  Cabbage"
- "2 Green onions"
- "2 clove Garlic"
- "1 clove Ginger"
- "70 ml Chicken bone soup"
- " Filling Seasonings"
- "2 tbsp Oyster sauce"
- "2 tbsp Shaoxing wine"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Lard"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1 dash Pepper"
- "1 dash Ichimi spice"
- "1 tbsp Sesame oil"
- " For the dough"
- "150 grams Bread strong flour"
- "150 grams Cake flour"
- "170 ml Hot water"
- "1 tsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the pork and all the filling seasoning ingredients and mix well."
- "Add the chicken bone soup and mix well. Let sit for at least 15 minutes."
- "Finely chop the green onions and cabbage, sprinkle on 1 teaspoon of salt (amount separate from listed ingredients) and let sit for about 10 minutes. Squeeze out the excess moisture."
- "Combine the meat from Step 2, the vegetables from Step 3, and the garlic and  finely chopped ginger and mix well. Roughly chop the garlic, finely chop the ginger."
- "Once mixed well, transfer to an air-tight container and let sit in the refrigerator. At this time, the entire mixture should weigh about 650 g."
- "Make the skins while you wait for the filling to rest in the refrigerator. Mix together the bread flour and cake flour. Mix the salted hot water into the flour 1/3 at a time."
- "Once it comes together, put onto a board and knead. Knead well using your body weight."
- "Wrap with plastic wrap and let rest. Let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes."
- "Divide the dough into 40 pieces and arrange in a shallow container. Cover with a moistened and tightly wrung out towel so that it doesn&#39;t dry out."

- "If you don&#39;t dust with flour well enough, the dough will stick to the pan. The skins will also dry easily, so cover with a moistened and wrung out towel. (Be careful not to let the towel touch the skins.)"
- "Use a spatula to fill the skins with the fillings. About 1 heaping tablespoon per skin (about 15 g). If you don&#39;t completely close the skin, the juices will come out."
- "Heat a large amount of oil in a frying pan and arrange the gyoza in the pan. Add 500 ml of hot water to the pan, cover with the lid, turn the heat to high, and steam-fry until the moisture is gone."
- "When most of the moisture is gone, open the lid and let the remaining moisture evaporate. Finally, add 1 tablespoon of oil, fry until crispy, and it&#39;s done!"
- "If you want all the gyoza to stick together like the picture, fry with 1 heaping tablespoon of flour dissolved in 200 ml of water. See.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/153079-how-to-cook-gyoza-dumplings-with-wings"
