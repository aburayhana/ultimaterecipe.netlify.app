- "When the dumplings have plumped up, the skins should be translucent enough so that you can see water inside the dumplings boiling away. Make sure that almost all the water in the pan has evaporated..."
- "...then drizzle in vegetable or sesame oil, raise the heat a bit, and crisp up the bottom of the dumplings and the &#34;wings.&#34; Lift up and peek at the edges to make sure the bottoms are browned. If they look crispy and golden, they&#39;re done."
- "To freeze them: Line a shallow container with plastic wrap and put the gyoza dumplings in a single layer on top. Put in the freezer. When the surface is hard and frozen, transfer to plastic bags and put back in the freezer. They are uncooked and don&#39;t last that long, so use them up quickly."
- "To defrost or thaw them: Just cook them as you would freshly made dumplings. Make sure the dumplings reach the stage described in Step 5. If the insides are still cold they will be awful."
