- "After the sauce and noodles are cooked and the cheese blend is made, it is time to start layering your lasagna. Using large (13x9) and deep pan start with a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan.  Note: Disposable aluminium pans work well for this as they are typically deeper than a standard 13x9 pan and it makes clean up that much easier."
- "Next add a single layer of lasagna noodles. Typically the pan will be a little wider than the width of 3 whole noodles. To get better noodle coverage, cut the edge of a lasagna noodle lengthwise to fill the gap. A pizza cutter works great for this."
