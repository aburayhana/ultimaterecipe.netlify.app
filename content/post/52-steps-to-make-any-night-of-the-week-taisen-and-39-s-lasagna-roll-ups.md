If the cottage cheese is to wet add in more parmesean cheese or you can use an egg. I didn&#39;t use an egg and it was fine. I also added in extra garlic powder. You can add salt and pepper if you like or leave it out. Mix well. I don&#39;t like riccata so the cottage cheese were for mine."
- "In a separate bowl add in your riccata cheese. Add in same ingredients - garlic powder, basil, oregano and parsley. My husband added some of the extra cottage cheese to this as well. You can add salt and pepper if you like or leave it out. My husband and kids like riccata and sometimes they blend it with cottage to."
- "Put some sauce in your onions and stir. Taste for flavor. Add anything you need to your desired taste. I did this with mine. I&#39;m not a fan of ricotta and the kids and husband don&#39;t like onion and stuff. I used this for the top of my dish."
