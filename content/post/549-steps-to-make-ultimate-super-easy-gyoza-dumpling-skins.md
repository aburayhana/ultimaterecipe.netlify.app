recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the bread and cake flours in a bowl, and add boiling water. Mix with a rubber spatula lightly."

- "(Continued)  Add water 1/3 of the way up on the side of the Gyoza. Cover with a lid, and turn down the heat to low. When there is barely any water, remove the lid and bring up the heat to high. Pour vegetable oil around the pan, and the Gyoza is ready when the bottom is nicely browned."
- "How to boil Gyoza: Drop Gyoza into boiling water. Boil for 2~3 minutes after they float to the surface. The Gyoza is ready when they puff up. Drain quickly and enjoy."
