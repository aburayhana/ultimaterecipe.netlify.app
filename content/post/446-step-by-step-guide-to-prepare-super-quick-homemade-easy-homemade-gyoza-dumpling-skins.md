- "100 grams Flour Cake flour is supposed to be the best"
- "60 to 85 ml Boiling water depends on the type of flour apparently"

recipeinstructions:
- "Put the flour in a bowl and add the hot water little by little until a crumbly dough is formed. Don&#39;t keep adding hot water even if some is left over; test the texture of the dough instead."
- "The dough will come together as you knead it. If the dough is too stiff, add a little bit of hot water until it&#39;s just a bit stiffer than the texture of your earlobe to adjust."
- "When the dough comes together, roll it into a ball and wrap in plastic film. Leave it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes, and make the filling in the meantime. See."
- "Take the dough out. Dust your work surface and knead the dough again, and roll it out with a rolling pin. (The more you knead it, the more pliable and chewy it will become.)"
- "Cut the dough out with a circular cutter. If you don&#39;t have one just use a mug or glass as a cutter."
- "Flour the skins generously to prevent them from sticking to each other. The gyoza skins are done."
- "Wrap them around the filling, and line them up in a shallow floured stainless steel container.  Make sure to close up the dumplings or the meat juices will leak out while cooking!"
- "Then just pan fry them. See how to do this here -  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143867-how-to-cook-crispy-and-juicy-gyoza-dumplings"
- "Put any leftover dumplings in the stainless steel container, cover with plastic wrap and into the freezer."
- "When the gyoza dumplings are frozen, put them one by on into a ziplock bag and store in the freezer. Take out as many as you like to cook!"
- "If you have some leftover skins, wrap them with a newspaper flyer, then with plastic wrap, and freeze. Transfer them to the refrigerator a day before you want to use them."
