recipeinstructions:
- "Start a pot of salted water for the pasta."
- "Assemble all ingredients."
- "Prep vegetables before beginning to cook the chicken."
- "Preheat oven to 200°F Fahrenheit. Preheat dinner plates."
- "Wash &amp; dry the chicken. Place between plastic wrap and pound to 1/4 &#34; thick."
- "Arrange the prosciutto on top of the chicken pieces. Arrange the sage leaves on the prosciutto. Use toothpicks to hold the sage on."
- "Dredge the chicken bundles in flour. Shake off any extra flour."
- "Heat half of the oil in a skillet. When shimmering, add 3 bundles, sage side down. Cook on medium high for about 3 minutes. Turn carefully and cook for 3-5 minutes more.
