recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the garlic chives and cabbage leaves roughly. Chop the ginger and garlic finely. Combine these vegetables with the minced pork in a bowl."
- "Add all the seasonings and mix well for about 5 minutes until the mixture becomes slightly sticky. Leave to rest at room temperature."
- "How to make gyoza dumpling skins. Put the flour into a bowl and pour in boiling water. Mix roughly with chopsticks. When the dough is cooled down enough to handle, knead the dough for about five minutes until it becomes elastic and smooth."
- "Divide the smooth dough into two and wrap in cling film. Leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes."

- "Wet the edges of the round skin and stuff with the filling, sealing the folded skin together."
- "When you fry half the gyoza. Heat the frying pan over high heat. Put two tablespoons of vegetable oil and place in the gyoza dumplings. Pour over 100 ml of hot water and cover. Fry for about five minutes over high heat."
- "After 5 minutes, all the water should have almost evaporated, so drizzle oil on the side of the frying pan. Fry until the gyoza are golden brown, then serve."
- "P.S.: When you want to have really crispy gyoza, you can make these changes to the gyoza skin recipe:   1 and 1/2 cup of plain flour.  1/2 cup of strong (bread) flour.  150 ml of boiling water.  Dumplings made like this are really tasty, too."
