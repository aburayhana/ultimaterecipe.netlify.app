recipeingredient:
- "1 heaping tablespoon Plain flour"
- "200 ml Water"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the flour with water. Mix well so that there are no lumps. Strain out any lumps with a fine mesh sieve or tea strainer."
- "Heat up a frying pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. When the oil is hot and flowing easily, put in the gyoza dumplings in a single layer."
- "Turn the heat up to the maximum level, add the flour-water mixture from Step 1 and cover with a lid. Turn the heat down to medium-high and steam-cook for 3 minutes or so."
- "The dumplings won&#39;t burn as long as there&#39;s water in the pan, but once the water is gone they&#39;ll burn very quickly so be careful. When the gyoza start to make crackling noises, take the lid off."
- "Cook for another 3 minutes or so with the lid off to let any remaining moisture evaporate. Once the moisture is gone, cook for another minute to brown the dumplings. Leave the heat set to medium-high."
- "After a minute, invert a plate on top of the frying pan. If oil drips on your arm you&#39;ll burn yourself, so be careful."
- "The gyoza dumplings with &#34;wings&#34; are done! All the dumplings are connected together with the &#34;wings,&#34; but you can separate them easily with chopsticks. There are 24 dumplings in this photo."
