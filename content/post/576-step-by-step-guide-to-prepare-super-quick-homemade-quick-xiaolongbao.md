Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, quick xiaolongbao. One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

You will be amazed by the treasure elixir oozing from the paper-thin skin when you poke it gently with the chopsticks. Easy Xiao Long Bao Dumplings Put a small spoonful of meat mixture into the center of gyoza wrapper.

Quick Xiaolongbao is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It's appreciated by millions daily. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. Quick Xiaolongbao is something which I have loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.

##### The ingredients needed to make Quick Xiaolongbao:

1. Take 100 grams Ground pork
1. Take 1/3 Japanese leek
1. Prepare 1 Ginger juice
1. Take 1 Store-bought coffee jelly
1. Take 8 pieces Gyoza dumpling skins
1. Make ready  (The list below are the ingredients that I added to the original recipe)
1. Get 1 Salt and pepper
1. Make ready 1/4 Onion
1. Make ready 2/3 tbsp Chinese soup stock
1. Get 1 tbsp Soy sauce
1. Get 1 Oyster sauce


Then add pork chunks in a blender, add salt, sugar, pepper, light soys sauce and oyster sauce. However, xiaolongbao are not sturdy enough to squeeze and eat as they sit pinched between chopsticks. Instead, they will usually leak their delicious broth back into the steamer or, worse, over the table top. Fingers don&#39;t work, either, and it is instead a job for the chopsticks and the classic Chinese soup spoon.

1. Chop the Japanese leek and onion finely.  Add all the ingredients into a plastic bag and mix well.
1. Place a piece of gyoza skin into a bento divider cup and add an adequate amount of filling from Step 1 into it.
