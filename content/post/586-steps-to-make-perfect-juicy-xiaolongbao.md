recipeingredient:
- " Manju dough"
- "450 grams Allpurpose flour"
- "250 grams Water"
- "3 12 grams Dry yeast"
- " Ingredients"
- "280 grams Minced pork ground"
- "25 ml Soy sauce"
- "10 ml Sake"
- "20 grams Minced Japanese leek"
- "1 thumbtipsized knob Ginger minced"
- "250 grams Daikon radish"
- "50 ml Peanut oil"
- "1 1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1/2 tsp Chicken soup stock granules"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the skins to start with. Mix the all-purpose flour, water, and dry yeast together and knead well. Add a little water to start with, and add sparingly until the dough reaches a firmness (should feel like your earlobe)."
- "It&#39;s good to go once the slippery stickiness has dissipated and the surface smooths. Place into a bowl and cover with a wet cloth, and proof for 30 minutes. You can let it sit at room temperature even during the summer. (It&#39;s necessary to place the bowl into a hot water bath if it&#39;s cold outside, and to place into a warm location)."
- "Make the filling. First of all, mix the • ingredients"
- "Cut the daikon radish into large thin strips. (It&#39;s a breeze if you run it though a slicer). Add to a pot along with water, and prep the daikon radish by boiling lightly. Drain in a colander and let cool, and lightly squeeze out the water."
- "Mix the meat from step three, the daikon radish from step 4, peanut oil, and chicken soup stock together, and then stir in one direction with cooking chopsticks. The filling is now ready to use."
- "Check on the skins. They are ready once they have doubled in size, and make a nice sound when you smack them with your hand. (Like smacking a watermelon.) Put them out onto some dusting flour, and lightly knead once more until smooth."
- "Shape the skins. Stretch the dough out to a 3-4 cm thick oval, and rip about 20 g off of the end. Lightly roll into a ball, and press down onto it with the palm of your hand to flatten it out. Roll this into a 9 cm long oval that is 1-2 mm thick. The point is to make the center slightly thicker."
- "Wrap up the filling. Place a skin into the palm of your hand. Place the filling into the center of the skin, pinch the edges with the thumbs and index fingers of your left and right hands, and wrap it up while pulling it up from the sides. Flip it over, pinch tightly, and make sure there are no openings."
- "Steam in a steamer. Lightly coat the steamer with oil before putting them in to prevent sticking. They will plump up when steaming, so leave some space between each one. Cook on a high heat for 5 minutes initially, then at a low heat for 7-8 minutes. Serve them piping hot."
