- "1 piece Ginger finely chopped"
- "120 ml Chicken stock"
- " To flavor the filling"
- "3 tbsp Oyster sauce"
- "3 tbsp Sake or preferably Shaoxing wine"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tsp Salt"
- "2 tbsp Sesame oil"

- "1 Cake flour to dust the work surface"
- " For the sauce"
- "30 ml Soy sauce"
- "60 ml Vinegar"
- "10 ml Sesame oil"
- "1 Rayu"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ground pork and all the filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well."
- "Add the chicken soup and mix well. Leave the filling like this for 10 minutes, to let the ground pork absorb lots of soup."
- "Chop up the leek and cabbage fairly roughly. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt (not listed in the ingredients) and leave for 10 minutes. Tightly squeeze out the moisture."
- "Combine the Step 2 meat mixture, finely chopped garlic and ginger, the Step 3 cabbage, and leek."
- "Mix well, put into a container with a tightly sealing lid, and let it sit for a while in the refrigerator."
- "While the filling is resting, make the skins. Combine the bread and cake flours. Dissolve the salt in the boiling water, and add this to the flour mixture in 3 batches while mixing well."
- "When the dough comes together in one ball, place it on a work surface and knead well, while putting your weight into it. Wrap in plastic and rest for 20 minutes at room temperature."
- "Roll the dough out into thin ropes. Divide into 60 pieces and roll each piece into balls."
- "Flatten each ball of dough with your palm, and roll the dough out with a rolling pin. Dust generously with flour. Roll the dough out to a 1 mm thickness with a diameter close to 10 cm."
- "If you don&#39;t flour the dough generously, the pieces will get stuck to each other. The thickness is more important than the shape of the skins."
- "Fill and form the dumplings. Put a generous amount of filling on each skin and then remove any excess. This way, the edge of the skin will be moistened so there&#39;s no need to put water on it."
- "Put the filled dumplings on a shallow tray."
- "Bring plenty of water to a boil in a wok, and add the gyoza dumplings. They are liable to stick to the bottom of the wok right after they&#39;re added, so stir them up gently with a ladle."
- "When the dumplings float to the surface they are done. Transfer them to servings plates, and serve with the special sauce or ponzu sauce, and cold beer!"
